# Amplicon Sequencing Analysis: Cryptosporidium in Bovine Gut

This repository contains an independent amplicon sequencing project investigating **Cryptosporidium infection in bovine gut microbiomes**. The study applies 16S rRNA sequencing data and downstream microbial community profiling to uncover microbial shifts associated with infection.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This study focuses on characterizing microbial community composition in bovine intestinal samples, comparing infected and non-infected groups using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Statistical and ecological analyses were performed to identify differentially abundant taxa and visualize community-level variation.
